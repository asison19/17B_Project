in the move method, but now it doesn't stop.

//was finally able to get it to stop moving using keyReleaseEvent(), but now it won't move diagonally
//bullets look more like a "tail" and don't look like they're moving
//if move then shoot, character stops moving but shoots. if shoot then move, everything is relatively fine

//Nov 24, 8:43
//movement works perfectly, including shift to slow down
	turns out i left the else statements for keyPressEvent()
//ToDo:	
	implement QVector2D for bullets to prepare for the fancier shit.
	make screen 900 x 1200 ? See if its good.
//Nov 26
	took out mob and replaced it with enemy_1
	added collision for projectile and enemy_1
//Nov 27
	added bulletMediumRed
	added bullet and bulletMedium class as parent and child respectively
		bulletMedium is not being fired from enemy_1 properly

//Nov 28
	bulletMedium now works, but without any collision detection with the character player.
ToDo:
	add hitbox for character, add color heuristic for the bullet or anything to make it more accurate
	add collision detection for the above two.
	fix red medium bullet image, border is too light, white center is off center
	create more bullet colours and patterns
	design a good game level
	add a boss at the end
//Nov 29
	added hitbox image, still haven't done collision detection
ToDo:	same as yesterday
//Dec 01
	added hitbox collision with bullets, and added iframes after just getting hit
	added lives as an int only, no proper conqequences to running out
	changed images 
ToDo:	
	create barrier so player can't leave the game screen.
	create a good game level by adding more enemies, more bullets and a boss
	add bombs for player character
	add proper logistics to bombs and lives
	add sound
//Dec 02
	added system to keep player inside the playable section
	added collsion for player and enemies
	polished and created new functions to keep character's move() cleaner
	added comments
	added some sounds
ToDo:
	create a good game level by adding more enemies, more bullets and a boss
	add bombs for player character
	add proper logistics to bombs and lives
	add more sound?
