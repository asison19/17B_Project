# 17B_Project
Project for 17B that I turned in as is.
For this project we had to create anything we wanted that uses a GUI.
I decided I wanted to make a bullet-hell/danmaku shoot em up game.
You move with the arrow keys and press 'z' to shoot.
You can press and hold shift to go slower and display your hitbox.

This project was made using the qt api and the compiler Qt Creator 4.1.0

I also removed the song that was used since i wasn't sure if I can upload it here
The song was "Failure" by Lukhash
