# 17B_Project
Project for 17B that I turned in as is.
For this project we had to create anything we wanted that uses a GUI.
I decided I wanted to make a bullet-hell/danmaku shoot em up game.
You move with the arrow keys and press 'z' to shoot.
You can press and hold shift to go slower and display your hitbox.
